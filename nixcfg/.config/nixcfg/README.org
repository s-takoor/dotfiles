In the beginning, there was ~nix~. All things were made by ~nix~; and without it was not any thing made that was made. In ~nix~ was life; and life was the light of the ~systems~. And the light shineth in ~systems~; and the ~systems~ comprehendeth it not. For ~nix~ is ~declarative~, ~immutable~, and ~reproducible~, bringing order and harmony to the ~systems~.

* 🎯 OVERVIEW
~Nix~ is a powerful package manager for ~Linux~ and ~Unix~ systems that ensures ~reproducible~, ~declarative~, and ~reliable~ software management.

This ~README~ file serves as the blueprint for the system configuration. It uses a process known as ~tangling~ to automatically generate and organize all necessary ~.nix~ files for this setup.

Here's how it helps manage everything:
- ~tangling configurations~: the ~README.org~ file automatically generates the required ~.nix~ files from the ~org-mode~ content
- ~organize files~: after ~tangling~, it creates and organizes all the ~.nix~ files into the appropriate directories (creating directories if they don't exist with the ~:mkdirp yes~ option)
- ~imports~ and ~dependencies~: the generated ~flake.nix~ file pulls in other ~.nix~ files to manage dependencies and configurations
- ~takeaway~: modifications are made only in this ~README.org~ file and the ~org-auto-tangle~ feature from ~emacs~ handles the creation and updating all necessary ~config~ files

Here's a breakdown of what the ~README.org~ is generating:

* 🗒️ FEATURES
- [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Flakes]]: enhances ~reproducibility~ and ~modularity~ in ~nix~ configurations
- [[https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/][Home-Manager]]: manages user configurations and environment settings
- [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]]: core package manager for declarative system configuration
- [[https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs?tab=readme-ov-file][Nixpkgs]]: package repository providing the software available through ~nix~

* 🛠️ INSTALLATION
Ways to install ~nix~ on ~macos~:
- the official ~nix~ installer from [[https://nixos.org/download/][nixos.org]]
- the [[https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer][shell installer]] from ~determinate systems~
- the [[https://determinate.systems/posts/graphical-nix-installer/][graphical installer]] from ~determinate systems~ for ~macos~

The ~determinate systems~ installers have several advantages over the original ~nix~ installer:
- provides a nicer overview of the installation steps
- designed to survive ~macos~ upgrades
- ~Flakes~ are enabled by default
- installation and configuration can be customized

The graphical install also includes:
- compatibility with ~Mobile Device Management (MDM)~ solutions
- [[https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/][signed]] with ~Determinate System~'s Apple developer ID

To install ~nix~ using the ~determinate systems~ shell installer, run:
#+begin_src sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
When using ~nix-darwin~ to change system-level configurations, you might end up having two different versions of ~nix~ if installed via the ~determinate systems~ installer; [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/issues/931][issue #931]]
#+end_quote

Here's an example of the ~std.out~ from the ~nix doctor~ or ~nix config check~ ( for newer versions of ~nix~ ) commands:
#+begin_src sh
[FAIL] Multiple versions of nix found in PATH:
  /nix/store/{nxi-related-path}-nix-2.23.3/bin
  /nix/store/{nxi-related-path}-nix-2.18.5/bin

[PASS] All profiles are gcroots.
[PASS] Client protocol matches store protocol.
[INFO] You are trusted by store uri: daemon
#+end_src

* 📝 DECLARATIVE SYSTEM FOR MACOS
~Nix~ provides a ~declarative~, ~immutable~ and ~reproducible~ approach to system management. Although still considered as experimental, ~flakes~ are a core component of this approach, ensuring ~consistency~ and ~reliability~ in system configurations.

* ❄️ FLAKE
The ~flake.nix~ is the main entry-point. The standard format for the ~flake.nix~ consists of:
- ~inputs~: which are dependencies of the flake required for the configuration and,
- ~outputs~: which are function that returns the build results of the flake based on the inputs, shaping the final setup

#+begin_quote
Trust in the ~code~ with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge it, and it shall direct thy paths, ensuring ~reproducible~, ~declarative~, and ~reliable~ software management.

* 📚 MODULES
** DARWIN
The [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]] project offers a declarative approach to system configuration on ~macos~ streamlining system management through a ~nix-darwin~ configuration file. This approach integrates with ~home-manager~ to offer a unified way to manage both system and user environments.

*** DARWIN SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
In this setup ~nix-darwin~ is utilized to handle system-level configurations, including the setup of system services and user environments. ~Home-manager~ is integrated as a module within the ~nix-darwin~ configuration, enabling the management of user environments from the system configuration file.

** HOME-MANAGER
~Home-Manager~ integrates with ~nix~ to manage user environments ~declaratively~. In other words, ~home-manager~ allows:
- installing software ~declaratively~ in the ~user profile~, rather than using ~nix-env~
- managing ~dotfiles~ in the home directory of the user
- maintaining ~dotfiles~ and personal configurations effortlessly

#+begin_quote
Embrace the ~home-manager~, for it is the shepherd of thy ~home~ configuration. With it, thy ~dotfiles~ shall be ~declarative~, ~reproducible~, and ~version-controlled~, bringing consistency and harmony to thy environment. Trust in the ~home-manager~ with all thine ~home~ setup, and lean not on manual tweaks; acknowledge it in all thy ~dotfiles~, and it shall make thy setup paths straight.

The command ~nix develop~ is used to enter a development environment defined by the ~shell.nix~ file. It sets up the environment specified in the file, making the listed tools and configurations available in an isolated shell.

* ⚠️ APPLYING THE CONFIGURATION
** BUILD
This command builds the ~darwin~ configuration specified in the ~flake.nix~ file. This generates a ~result~ that can be used to switch the system configuration. This is only required once to build the system configuration.

#+begin_quote
If there's already an ~/etc/nix/nix.conf~ ( installed via the ~nix~ ~determinate systems~ ) file from a previous installation, rename it to ~/etc/nix/nix.conf.bak~ to avoid conflicts during the build process.
#+end_quote

The following command builds the configuration:
#+begin_src sh
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' build .#darwinConfigurations.${hostname}.system
#+end_src

** SWITCH
This command applies the newly built configuration. The ~darwin-rebuild~ command, part of ~nix-darwin~, applies the changes specified in the build. Make sure to replace ~${hostname}~ with the actual ~hostname~ of the system.

Apply the newly built configuration:
#+begin_src sh
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#${hostname}
#+end_src

** UPDATE
To update all inputs and dependencies, which in turn updates the ~fake.lock~ file, use the following command:
#+begin_src sh
nix flake update
#+end_src

After updating, it is recommended to perform a ~darwin-rebuild switch~ to apply any new changes.

** LIST GENERATIONS
Run the following command to list all system generations
#+begin_src sh
darwin-rebuild --list-generations
#+end_src

This command lists all available system generations, including their generation numbers and descriptions.

** SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT GENERATION
To switch to a different system generation, first identify the generation number from the list obtained using the above command. Then, run the following command to switch to that generation:
#+begin_src sh
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --generation <generation_number>
#+end_src

Replace the ~<generation_number>~ with the desired generation number.

To return to the most recent system generation, use:
#+begin_src sh
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --generation current
#+end_src

** MANUAL CLEAN UP
If manual cleanup is required, run the following command to clean up old and unused package versions, including previous system generations, to reclaim disk space:
#+begin_src sh
sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
#+end_src

* ☣️ UNINSTALLATION
** UNINSTALLING NIX DARWIN
If you have ~nix-darwin~ configured, uninstalling ~nix~ might fail using the ~determinate systems~ uninstaller because ~nix-darwin~ overwrites the ~/etc/nix/nix.conf~ file. To avoid issues, uninstall ~nix-darwin~ first.

Use the provided uninstaller to remove ~nix-darwin~. This script cleans up ~nix-darwin~ configurations and related systems integration. Ensure the ~darwin-uninstaller~ script is available in the ~~/.config/nix-darwin~ directory.
#+begin_src sh
# navigate to the directory where the uninstaller is located
z ~/.config/nix-darwin

# execute the uninstaller script to remove `nix-darwin`
./result/sw/bin/darwin-uninstaller
#+end_src

or, if the symbolic link is not available, directly reference the uninstaller script in the ~nix store~:
#+begin_src sh
# replace the <nix-store-path> with the actual path of the `darwin-uninstaller` in the `nix-store`
/nix/store/<nix-store-path>-darwin-uninstaller/bin/darwin-uninstaller
#+end_src

** UNINSTALLING NIX
After removing ~nix-darwin~, you can proceed to uninstall ~nix~. The ~determinate systems~ installer provides an uninstaller script for removing ~nix~ and its associated files. Before running the ~determinate systems~ uninstaller script, ensure to restore the ~/etc/nix.conf.bak~ file ( depending how it was renamed during the ~nix-darwin~ installation ) back to ~/etc/nix/nix.conf~

#+begin_src sh
# run the Determinate Systems uninstaller script
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
#+end_src

** ADDITIONAL CLEANUP
If there are leftover files or directories after uninstallation, clean them up manually. Common directories to check include:
- Remove the ~nix~ directory
  #+begin_src sh
sudo rip /nix
  #+end_src

- Remove ~nix~ configuration files
  #+begin_src
sudo rip /etc/nix
sudo rip /etc/profile.d/nix.sh
  #+end_src

- Remove ~nix~ ~user~ and ~group~
#+begin_src sh
sudo dscl . -delete /Users/nixbld
sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/nixbld
#+end_src

- Clean up ~environment variables~
  + ~bashrc~
  + ~zshrc~
  + ~/.config/fish/config.fish~

If ever errors are encountered during/after uninstallation, refer to the [[https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.22/installation/uninstall][nix reference manual]] for additional guidance on manually uninstalling ~nix~ from the system.
