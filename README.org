** üöÄ TL;DR
 This is a repository for my dotfiles.

** üß∞ GNU STOW
`dotfiles` are symlinked on my machines using GNU Stow, a symlink farm manager. Below is a quick guide on how to use it.
*** INSTALLATION
#+begin_src sh
brew install stow
#+end_src

*** LINK WITH STOW
#+begin_src sh
stow -v tmux
#+end_src

*** UNLINK WITH STOW
#+begin_src sh
stow -vD tmux
#+end_src

**** A FEW ADDITIONAL TIPS
- Use the `-t` option with Stow to specify the target directory.
#+begin_src sh
stow -v -t ~ tmux
#+end_src

- Stow multiple packages at once.
#+begin_src sh
stow -v -t ~ tmux vim
#+end_src

- Use the `-n` or `--no` option to see what Stow will do without making changes
  #+begin_src sh
stow -vn tmux
  #+end_src
